<h1>Solution: Chracter</h1>

<h3>Here this challange wanted you to enter a index of a string to obtain the flag. What you where supposed to do was make a script but I decided to just find the end of the index which was 103 and then enter each index individually. Not to smartest Idea but got the job done LOL!</h3>


<h3>The flag comes out to be HTB{tH15_1s_4_r3aLly_l0nG_fL4g_i_h0p3_f0r_y0Ur_s4k3_tH4t_y0U_sCr1pTEd_tH1s_oR_els3_iT_t0oK_qU1t3_l0ng!!}</h3>
